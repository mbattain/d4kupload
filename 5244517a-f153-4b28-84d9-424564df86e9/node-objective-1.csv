"Main objective","Objective","OBJ1","To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship (overall Type 1 erroralpha=0.05) between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores, and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg]).","e65577a9-3af7-42c0-8d89-d4421c7e36e8","","Objective_1"
"Safety","Objective","OBJ2","To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.","7ab515fb-0f48-4cd1-960d-77ed1eff15e4","","Objective_2"
"Behaviour","Objective","OBJ3","To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
