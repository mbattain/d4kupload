"<div><p>The M1 muscarinic-cholinergic receptor is 1 of 5 characterized muscarinic-cholinergic receptor subtypes (Fisher and Barak 1994). M1 receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus are, for the most part, preserved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the presynaptic neurons projecting to these receptors from the nucleus basalis of Meynert degenerate (Bierer et al. 1995). The presynaptic loss of cholinergic neurons has been correlated to the antimortum cognitive impairment in AD patients, prompting speculation that replacement therapy with cholinomimetics will alleviate the cognitive dysfunction of the disorder (Fisher and Barak 1994).</p>
<p>Xanomeline is a novel M1 agonist which has shown high affinity for the M1 receptor subtype (in transfected cells), and substantially less or no affinity for other muscarinic subtypes. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of 11C-labeled xanomeline in cynomolgus monkeys have suggested that the compound crosses the blood-brain barrier and preferentially binds the striatum and neocortex.</p>
<p>Clinical development of an oral formulation of xanomeline for the indication of mild and moderate AD was initiated approximately 4 years ago. A large-scale study of safety and efficacy provided evidence that an oral dosing regimen of 75 mg three times daily (TID) may be associated with enhanced cognition and improved clinical global impression, relative to placebo. As well, a dramatic reduction in psychosis, agitation, and other problematic behaviors, which often complicate the course of the disease, was documented. However, the discontinuation rate associated with this oral dosing regimen was 58.6%, and alternative clinical strategies have been sought to improve tolerance for the compound.</p>
<p>To that end, development of a Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) has been initiated. Relative to the oral formulation, the transdermal formulation eliminates high concentrations of xanomeline in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and presystemic (firstpass) metabolism. Three transdermal delivery systems, hereafter referred to as the xanomeline TTS Formulation A, xanomeline TTS Formulation B, and xanomeline TTS formulation E have been manufactured by Lohman Therapy Systems GmbH of Andernach Germany. TTS Formulation A is 27 mg xanomeline freebase in a 25-cm2 matrix. TTS Formulation B is 57.6 mg xanomeline freebase in a 40-cm2 matrix. Formulation E has been produced in 2 patch sizes: 1) 54 mg xanomeline freebase with 0.06 mg Vitamin E USP in a 50-cm2 matrix and 2) 27 mg xanomeline freebase with 0.03 mg Vitamin E USP in a 25-cm2 matrix. For a detailed description of the composition of these formulations please refer to Part II, Section 14 of the Xanomeline (LY246708) Clinical Investigator's Brochure. For characterization of the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of xanomeline TTS Formulations A, B, and E, please refer to Part II, Sections 7, 8, and 10 of the Xanomeline (LY246708) Clinical Investigator's Brochure. Formulation E will be studied in this protocol, H2Q-MC-LZZT(c).</p></div>","SECTION 1","NarrativeContent","cca52195-3824-4236-a1d2-7725b9161ecc","1","NarrativeContent_3","Introduction"

"<div><p>Patients with probable mild to moderate AD will be studied in a randomized, double-blind, parallel (3 arm), placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks duration. The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Approximately 300 patients will be enrolled (see Schedule of Events for Protocol H2Q-MC-LZZT(c), Attachment LZZT.1).</p>
<p>Following informed consent, patients will be screened at Visit 1. At screening, patients will undergo complete neuropsychiatric assessment, psychometric testing, and general medical assessment (including medical history, pre-existing conditions, physical examination). In addition, vital signs, temperature, medication history, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, and safety laboratories will be obtained. During the screening visit, patients will wear a placebo TTS to determine willingness and ability to comply with transdermal administration procedures. If patients have not had central nervous system (CNS) imaging in the previous 12 months, a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be obtained. If patients are insulin dependent diabetics, a hemoglobin A 1c will be obtained. Screening exams and procedures may be performed after Visit 1; however, their results must be completed and available prior to randomization. The screening process should occur within 2 weeks of randomization (Visit 3 of the study).</p>
<p>Patients who meet enrollment criteria from Visit 1 will proceed to Visit 2 at which time they will undergo a 24-hour Ambulatory ECG. At Visit 3 the Ambulatory ECG will be removed and patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. The treatment arms will include a placebo arm, a low-dose xanomeline arm (50 cm 2 TTS Formulation E, 54 mg xanomeline), and a high-dose xanomeline arm (75 cm 2 TTS Formulation E, 81 mg xanomeline). All patients receiving xanomeline will be started at 50 cm 2 TTS Formulation E. For the first 8 weeks of treatment, patients will be assessed at clinic visits every 2 weeks and, thereafter, at clinic visits every 4 weeks. Patients who discontinue prior to Visit 12 (Week 24) will be brought back for full efficacy assessments at or near to 24 weeks, whenever possible.</p>
<p>A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), chaired by an external cardiologist, will meet after 75, 150, 225, and 300 patients have completed 1 month of treatment. The DSMB will review cardiovascular findings to decide if discontinuation of the study or any treatment arm is appropriate, if additional cardiovascular monitoring is required, if further cardiovascular monitoring is unnecessary, or if adjustment of dose within a treatment arm (or arms) is appropriate (see Section 3.9.4).</p>
<p>At Visits 3, 8, 10, and 12, efficacy instruments (ADAS-Cog, CIBIC+, and DAD) will be administered. NPI-X will be administered at 2-week intervals either at clinic visits or via a telephone interview. Vital signs, temperature, and an assessment of adverse events will</p>
<p>be obtained at all clinic visits. An electrocardiogram (ECG), and chemistry/hematology safety labs will be obtained at Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Urinalysis will be done at Visits 4, 9, and 12. Use of concomitant medications will be collected at Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Plasma levels of xanomeline and metabolites will be obtained at Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11. At Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, medications will be dispensed to the patients.</p>
<p>Visits 1 through 13 should be scheduled relative to Visit 3 (Week 0 - randomization). Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, and 13 should occur within 3 days of their scheduled date. Visits 9, 10, 11, and 12 should occur within 4 days of their scheduled date. At Visit 13 patients will be given the option to enter the open-label extension phase (see Section 3.10.3. Study Extensions).</p>

"<div><p>Previous studies of the oral formulation have shown that xanomeline tartrate may improve behavior and cognition. Effects on behavior are manifest within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment. The same studies have shown that 8 to 12 weeks are required to demonstrate effects on cognition and clinical global assessment. This study is intended to determine the acute and chronic effects of the TTS formulation in AD; for that reason, the study is of 26 weeks duration. Dosage specification has been made on the basis of tolerance to the xanomeline TTS in a clinical pharmacology study (H2Q-EW-LKAA), and target plasma levels as determined in studies of the oral formulation of xanomeline (H2Q-MC-LZZA).</p>
<p>The parallel dosing regimen maximizes the ability to make direct comparisons between the treatment groups. The use of placebo allows for a blinded, thus minimally biased, study. The placebo treatment group is a comparator group for efficacy and safety assessment.</p>
<p>Two interim analyses are planned for this study. The first interim analysis will occur when 50% of the patients have completed Visit 8 (8 weeks). If required, the second interim analysis will occur when 50% of the patients have completed Visit 12 (24 weeks). (See Section 4.6, Interim Analyses.)</p></div>","SECTION 3.2.","NarrativeContent","dccaf757-0eb2-4b33-bdb9-b8a19adb347e","3.2.","NarrativeContent_9","Discussion of Design and Control"

"<div><p>To test acute tolerance of transdermal formulation, patients will have a TTS (placebo) administered at the start of Visit 1, and removed at the conclusion of Visit 1. The patient's and caregiver's willingness to comply with 26 weeks of transdermal therapy should be elicited, and those patients/caregivers unwilling to comply should be excluded.</p>
<p>Upon enrollment at Visit 3, and on the morning of each subsequent day of therapy , xanomeline or placebo will be administered with the application of 2 adhesive patches, one 50 cm2 in area, the other 25 cm2 in area. Each morning, prior to the application of the patches, hydrocortisone cream (1%) should be applied to the skin at the intended site of administration, rubbed in, and allowed to penetrate for approximately 30 minutes. Thereafter, excess cream should be wiped away and the patches applied.</p>
<p>The patches are to be worn continuously throughout the day, for a period of approximately 12 to 14 hours, and removed in the evening. After removal of the patches, hydrocortisone cream (1%) should be applied locally to the site of administration.</p>
<p>Patches should be applied to a dry, intact, non-hairy area. Applying the patch to a shaved area is not recommended. The application site of the patches should be rotated according to the following schedule:</p>

<p>Patients and caregivers are free to select either the left or right site within the constraints of the rotation schedule noted above. Patches should be applied at approximately the same time each day. For patients who habitually bathe in the morning, the patient should bathe prior to application of new patches. Every effort should be taken to allow for morning administration of the patches. Exceptions allowing administration of TTS patches at night instead of in the morning will be made on a case-by-case basis by the CRO medical monitor. In the event that some adhesive remains on the patient's skin and cannot be removed with normal bathing, a special solution will be provided to remove the adhesive.</p>
<p>Following randomization at Visit 3, patients will be instructed to call the site if they have difficulty with application or wearing of patches. In the event that a patch becomes detached, a new patch of the same size should be applied (at earliest convenience) to an area of the dermis adjacent to the detachment site, and the rotation schedule should be resumed the following morning. If needed, the edges of the patch may be secured with a special adhesive tape that will be provided. If daily doses are reduced, improperly administered, or if a patch becomes detached and requires application of a new patch on three or more days in any 30-day period, the CRO research physician will be notified.</p>
<p>If the daily dose is reduced or improperly administered in the 24 hours prior to any scheduled clinic visit, the visit should be rescheduled (except for early termination and retrieval visits).</p>
<p>Patients must be instructed to return all used and unused study drug to the investigator at each visit for proper disposal and CT reconciliation by the investigator.</p></div>","SECTION 3.6.2.","NarrativeContent","1764167b-ac6d-4ec3-acea-3788f95e8b30","3.6.2.","NarrativeContent_23","TTS Administration Procedures"

<li><p><b>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog):</b> ADAS-Cog is an established measure of cognitive function in Alzheimer's Disease. This scale has been incorporated into this study by permission of Dr. Richard C. Mohs and the American Journal of Psychiatry and was adapted from an article entitled, âThe Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS),â which was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Volume No.141, pages 1356-1364, November, 1984, Copyright 1984.</p>
<p><b>The ADAS-Cog (11) and the ADAS-Cog (14):</b> The ADAS-Cog (11) is a standard 11-item instrument used to assess word recall, naming objects, commands, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, orientation, word recognition tasks, spoken language ability, comprehension, word finding difficulty, and recall of test instructions. For the purposes of this study, three items (delayed word recall, attention/visual search task, and maze solution) have been added to the ADAS-Cog (11) to assess the patient's attention and concentration. The 14 item instrument will be referred to as the ADAS-Cog (14). At each efficacy visit, all 14 items will be assessed, and in subsequent data analyses, performance on the ADAS-Cog (14) and performance on the subset ADAS-Cog (11) will be considered.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Video-referenced Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC+):</b> The CIBIC+ is an assessment of the global clinical status relative to baseline. The CIBIC+ used in this study is derived from the Clinical Global Impression of Change, an instrument in the public domain, developed by the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Study Units Program (1 U01 AG10483; Leon Thal, Principal Investigator). The instrument employs semi-structured interviews with the patient and caregiver, to assess mental/cognitive state, behavior, and function. These domains are not individually scored, but rather are aggregated in the assignment of a global numeric score on a 1 to 7 scale (1 = marked improvement; 4 = no change; and 7 = marked worsening).</p>
<p>The clinician assessing CIBIC+ will have at least one year of experience with the instrument and will remain blinded to all other efficacy and safety measures.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X):</b> The NPI-X is an assessment of change in psychopathology in patients with dementia. The NPI-X is administered to the designated caregiver. This instrument has been revised from its original version (Cummings et al. 1994) and incorporated into this study with the permission of Dr. Jeffrey L. Cummings.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD):</b> The DAD is used to assess functional abilities of activities of daily living (ADL) in individuals with cognitive impairment. This scale has been revised and incorporated into this study by permission of Louise Gauthier, M.Sc., and Dr. Isabelle Gelinas. The DAD is administered to the designated caregiver.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For each instrument, each assessment is to be performed by the same trained health care professional. If circumstances preclude meeting this requirement, the situation is to be documented on the Clinical Report Form (CRF), and the CRO research physician is to be notified.</p>
<p>In addition to the efficacy measures noted above, a survey form will be used to collect information from the caregiver on TTS acceptability (Attachment LZZT.9).</p></div>","SECTION 3.9.1.1.","NarrativeContent","13d509bb-48ad-40e9-9473-13454097fab2","3.9.1.1.","NarrativeContent_28","Efficacy Measures"

"<div><p>Blood samples (7 mL) for the determination of xanomeline concentrations in plasma will be collected from each patient at Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11. The blood sample drawn at Visit 3 is a baseline sample. The remaining 5 clinic visits should be scheduled so that 1 blood sample is collected at any time during each of the following intervals: early AM visit (hold application of new patch until after blood sample is collected); 9AM to 11AM; 11AM to 1PM; 1PM to 3PM; and 3PM to 5PM. Collection of blood samples during each of these intervals should not occur in any particular order, nor should they occur in the same order for each patient. Every effort should be made to comply with the suggested sampling times. This blood-sampling schedule is based on a sparse sampling strategy where only a few samples will be collected from each patient. The most crucial aspect of the sampling design is to record the date and exact time the sample was drawn and to record the date and time of patch application on the day of the clinic visit and the previous 2 days.</p>
<p>If a patient is discontinued from the study prior to protocol completion, a pharmacokinetic blood sample should be drawn at the early discontinuation visit. The date and exact time the sample was drawn and the date of the last patch application should be recorded.</p>
<p>Immediately after collection, each sample will be centrifuged at approximately 177 Ã <i>G</i> for 15 minutes. The plasma will be transferred into a polypropylene tube bearing the identical label as the blood collection tube. Samples will be capped and frozen at approximately â20Â°C. Care must be taken to insure that the samples remain frozen during transit.</p>
<p>The samples will be shipped on dry ice to Central Laboratory.</p></div>","SECTION 3.9.2.","NarrativeContent","c2213bf9-d296-4209-ac1b-4702f25bc07c","3.9.2.","NarrativeContent_30","Pharmacokinetics"

"<div><b>Patients experiencing Rash and/or Eosinophilia</b>
<p>The administration of placebo and xanomeline TTS is associated with a rash and/or eosinophilia in some patients. The rash is characterized in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The rash is confined to sites of application.</p></li>
<li><p>The rash may be associated with pruritus.</p></li>
<li><p>In 5% of cases of rash observed in the Interim Analysis, blistering has been observed.</p></li>
<li><p>The onset of rash may occur at any time during the course of the study.</p></li>
<li><p>A moderate eosinophilia (0.6-1.5 x 103 /microliter) is associated with rash and has been noted in approximately 10% of patients.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It does not appear that the rash constitutes a significant safety risk; however, it could affect the well-being of the patients. The following monitoring is specified:</p>
<p><b>Skin Rash Follow-up</b></p>
<p>For patients who exit the study or its extension with rash at the site(s) of application:</p>
<ol type=""a"">
<li><p>Approximately 2 weeks after the last visit, the study site personnel should contact the patient/caregiver by phone and complete the skin rash questionnaire. (Note: those patients with rash who have previously exited the study or its extension should be contacted at earliest convenience.)</p></li>
<li><p>If caregiver states unequivocally that skin problems have completely resolved, no further follow-up is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>If caregiver reports scarring and/or other problems, patient should return to clinic for a follow-up visit. The skin rash questionnaire should again be completed. If in the opinion of the investigator, further follow-up is required, contact the CRO medical monitor. Completed skin rash questionnaires should be faxed to CRO.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Completion of the questionnaires will create a separate data set for solicited adverse events. In completing these forms please note the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Solicited events (events discovered as result of completion of follow-up questionnaires) should be reported on questionnaire page only.</p></li>
<li><p>Spontaneously reported adverse events (events presented by the patient without direct questioning of the event) should be reported as described in 3.9.3.2 .1 (Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Serious adverse events should be handled and reported as described in 3.9.3.2.1 without regard to whether the event is solicited or spontaneously reported.</p>
<p><b>Eosinophilia Follow-up</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>For patients that are currently in the study with eosinophil counts greater than 0. 6x10 3 /microliter:</p>

"<div><p>The CRO research physician will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular measures, including ECGs and 24-hour Ambulatory ECGs (see Section 3.9.3.4.2) will be monitored on an ongoing basis as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As noted in Section 3.9.3.4.2, all patients will be screened by obtaining a 12-lead ECG, and will have repeat ECGs performed at Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and early termination (ET) (see Schedule of Events for Protocol H2Q-MC-LZZT(c), Attachment LZZT.1). ECG data will be interpreted at the site and express mailed overnight to a central facility which will produce a report within 48 hours. The report will be forwarded to the investigator. At screening, the report of the central facility will be used to exclude patients according to criteria specified in Section 3.4.2.2. If, during the treatment phase of the study, review of ECG data (either at the site or at the central facility) reveals left bundle branch block, bradycardia â¤50 beats per minute, sinus pauses &gt;2 seconds, second degree heart block, third degree heart block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, or ventricular tachycardia at a rate of â¥120 beats per minute lasting â¥10 seconds, the investigator, the Lilly research physician, the CRO research physician, and the cardiologist chairing the DSMB will be notified immediately, and discontinuation of the patient will be considered.</p></li>
<li><p>As noted in Section 3.9.3.4.2, all patients will undergo a 24-hour Ambulatory ECG at Visit 2 (prior to the initiation of study medication).  Ambulatory ECG data from Visit 2 will be express mailed overnight to a central facility which will produce a report within 24 hours. The report will be forwarded to the investigator. If a report documents sustained ventricular tachycardia with rate &gt;120 beats per minute, third degree heart block, or sinus pauses of &gt;6.0 seconds, the investigator, the Lilly research 
physician, the CRO research physician, and the cardiologist chairing the DSMB will be notified immediately, and the patient will be discontinued. If any report documents sinus pauses of &gt;3.0 seconds or second degree heart block, the CRO research physician, and Lilly research physician, and cardiologist chairing the DSMB will be immediately notified and the record will be reviewed within 24 hours of notification by the cardiologist chairing the DSMB.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to ongoing monitoring of cardiac measures, a comprehensive, periodic review of cardiovascular safety data will be conducted by the DSMB, which will be chaired by an external cardiologist with expertise in arrhythmias, their pharmacological bases, and their clinical implications. The membership of the board will also include two other external cardiologists, a cardiologist from Lilly, a statistician from Lilly, and the Lilly research physician. Only the three external cardiologists will be voting members.</p>
<p>After approximately 75 patients have completed 1 month of treatment, the DSMB will meet to decide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If discontinuation of the study or any treatment arm is appropriate</p></li>
<li><p>If additional cardiovascular monitoring is required</p></li>
<li><p>If further cardiovascular monitoring is unnecessary</p></li>
<li><p>If adjustment of dose within a treatment arm (or arms) is appropriate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If necessary, this analysis will be repeated after 150 patients have completed 1 month of treatment, after 225 patients have completed 1 month of treatment, and after 300 patients have completed 1 month of treatment. Primary consideration will be given to the frequency of pauses documented in Ambulatory ECG reports. The number of pauses greater than or equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 seconds will be tabulated. Primary analysis will focus on the number of pauses greater than or equal to 3 seconds.</p>
<p>In the event of a high incidence of patient discontinuation due to syncope, the following guideline may be employed by the DSMB in determining if discontinuation of any treatment arm is appropriate. If the frequency of syncope in a xanomeline treatment arm relative to the frequency of syncope in the placebo arm equals or exceeds the following numbers, then consideration will be given to discontinuing that treatment arm. The Type I error rate for this rule is approximately 0.032 if the incidence in each group is 0.04. The power of this rule is 0.708 if the incidence is 0.04 for placebo and 0.16 for xanomeline TTS.</p>

"<div><p>Efficacy measures are described in Section 3.9.1.1. As stated in Section 3.9.1.2, the primary outcome measures are the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ instruments. Because both of these variables must reach statistical significance, an adjustment to the nominal p-values is necessary in order to maintain a .05 Type I error rate for this study. This adjustment is described in detail in Section 4.3.5.</p>
<p>The DAD will be analyzed with respect to the total score, as well as the subscores of 
initiation, planning and organization, and effective performance. This variable is 
considered a secondary variable in the US, but is a third primary variable in Europe.</p>
<p>The NPI-X is a secondary variable. The primary assessment of this instrument will be for the total score, not including the sleep, appetite, and euphoria domains. This total score is computed by taking the product of the frequency and severity scores and summing them up across the domains. Secondary variables derived from the NPI-X include evaluating each domain/behavior separately. Also, caregiver distress from the NPI-X will be analyzed.</p>
<p>ADAS-Cog (14) and each of the 14 individual components will also be analyzed. In addition, a subscore of the ADAS-Cog will be computed and analyzed, based on results from a previous large study of oral xanomeline. This subscore, referred to as ADAS-Cog (4), will be the sum of constructional praxis, orientation, spoken language ability, and word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech.</p>
<p>Any computed total score will be treated as missing if more than 30% of the items are missing or scored ânot applicableâ. For example, when computing ADAS-Cog(11), if 4 or more items are missing, then the total score will not be computed. When one or more items are missing (but not more than 30%), the total score will be adjusted in order to maintain the full range of the scale. For example, ADAS-Cog(11) is a 0-70 scale. If the first item, Word Recall (ranges from 0 to 10), is missing, then the remaining 10 items of the ADAS-Cog(11) will be summed and multiplied by (70 / (70-10) ), or 7/6. This computation will occur for all totals and subtotals of ADAS-Cog and NPI-X. DAD is a 40 item questionnaire where each question is scored as either â0â or â1â. The DAD total score and component scores are reported as percentage of items that are scored â1â. So if items of the DAD are ânot applicableâ or missing, the percentage will be computed for only those items that are scored. As an example, if two items are missing (leaving 38 that are scored), and there are 12 items scored as â1â, the rest as â0â, then the DAD score is 12/38=.316.</p></div>","SECTION 4.3.1.","NarrativeContent","3b766d91-bf1c-42c1-b952-700a11c40696","4.3.1.","NarrativeContent_53","Efficacy Variables to be Analyzed"
"<div><p>Baseline data will be collected at Visit 3.</p>
<p>The primary analysis of ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ will be the 24-week endpoint, which is defined for each patient and variable as the last measurement obtained postrandomization (prior to protocol defined reduction in dose).</p>
<p>Similar analyses at 24 weeks will be conducted for the secondary efficacy variables. Analysis of patients who complete the 24-week study will also be conducted for all efficacy variables; this is referred to as a âcompleterâ analysis.</p>
<p>Additionally, each of the efficacy variables will be analyzed at each time point both as âactual cases,â that is, analyzing the data collected at the various time points, and also as a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF). Note that the LOCF analysis at 24 weeks is the same as the endpoint analysis described previously.</p>
<p>Several additional analyses of NPI-X will be conducted. Data from this instrument will be collected every 2 weeks, and represent not the condition of the patient at that moment in time, but rather the worst condition of the patient in the time period since the most recent NPI-X administration. For this reason, the primary analysis of the NPI-X will be of the average of all postrandomization NPI-X subscores except for the one obtained at Week 2. In the event of early discontinuations, those scores that correspond to the interval between Weeks 2 to 24 will be averaged. The reason for excluding Week 2 data from this analysis is that patients could be confused about when a behavior actually stops after randomization; the data obtained at Week 2 could be somewhat âtainted.â Also, by requiring 2 weeks of therapy prior to use of the NPI-X data, the treatment difference should be maximized by giving the drug 2 weeks to work, thereby increasing the statistical power. Secondary analyses of the NPI-X will include the average of all postrandomization weeks, including measures obtained at Weeks 2 and 26.</p></div>","SECTION 4.3.2.","NarrativeContent","b44727c2-3eb0-4914-b27b-d4653f322319","4.3.2.","NarrativeContent_54","Times of Analyses"
"<div><p>The primary method to be used for the primary efficacy variables described in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 will be analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), except for CIBIC+ which is a score that reflects change from baseline, so there is no corresponding baseline CIBIC+ score. Effects in the ANCOVA model will be the corresponding baseline score, investigator, and treatment. CIBIC+ will be analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with effects in the model being investigator and treatment. Investigator-by-treatment interaction will be tested in a full model prior to conducting the primary ANCOVA or ANOVA (see description below).</p>
<p>Because 3 treatment groups are involved, the primary analysis will be the test for linear dose response in the ANCOVA and ANOVA models described in the preceding paragraph. The result is then a single p-value for each of ADAS-Cog and CIBIC+.</p>
<p>Analysis of the secondary efficacy variables will also be ANCOVA. Pairwise treatment comparisons of the adjusted means for all efficacy variables will be conducted using a LSMEANS statement within the GLM procedure.</p>
<p>Investigator-by-treatment interaction will be tested in a full ANCOVA or ANOVA model, which takes the models described above, and adds the interaction term to the model. Interaction will be tested at Î± = .10 level. When the interaction is significant at this level, the data will be examined for each individual investigator to attempt to identify the source of the significant interaction. When the interaction is not significant, this term will be dropped from the model as described above, to test for investigator and treatment main effects. By doing so, all ANCOVA and ANOVA models will be able to validly test for treatment differences without weighting each investigator equally, which is what occurs when using Type III sums of squares (cell means model) with the interaction term present in the model. This equal weighting of investigators can become a serious problem when sample sizes are dramatically different between investigators.</p>
<p>For all ANOVA and ANCOVA models, data collected from investigators who enrolled fewer than 3 patients in any one treatment group will be combined prior to analysis. If this combination still results in a treatment group having fewer than 3 patients in any one treatment group, then this group of patients will be combined with the next fewestenrolling investigator. In the event that there is a tie for fewest-enrolling investigator, one of these will be chosen at random by a random-number generator.</p>
<p>The inherent assumption of normally distributed data will be evaluated by generating output for the residuals from the full ANCOVA and ANOVA models, which include the interaction term, and by testing for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test from PROC UNIVARIATE. In the event that the data are predominantly nonnormally distributed, analyses will also be conducted on the ranked data. This rank transformation will be applied by ranking all the data for a particular variable, across all investigators and treatments, from lowest to highest. Integer ranks will be assigned starting at 1; mean ranks will be assigned when ties occur.</p>
<p>In addition, the NPI-X will be analyzed in a manner similar to typical analyses of adverse events. In this analysis, each behavior will be considered individually. This analysis is referred to as âtreatment-emergent signs and symptomsâ (TESS) analysis. For each behavior, the patients will be dichotomized into 1 of 2 groups: those who experienced the behavior for the first time postrandomization, or those who had the quotient between frequency and severity increase relative to the baseline period defines one group. All other patients are in the second group. Treatments will be compared for overall differences by Cochran-Mantel-Haentzel (CMH) test referred to in SASÂ® as ârow mean scores differ,â 2 degrees of freedom. The CMH correlation statistic (1 degree of freedom test), will test for increasing efficacy with increasing dose (trend test).</p></div>","SECTION 4.3.3.","NarrativeContent","01876f1a-2541-459d-978d-f3346cda331a","4.3.3.","NarrativeContent_55","Statistical Methodology"
"<div><p>All comparisons between xanomeline and placebo with respect to efficacy variables should be one-sided. The justification for this follows.</p>
<p>The statistical hypothesis that is tested needs to be consistent with the ultimate data-based decision that is reached. When conducting placebo-controlled trials, it is imperative that the drug be demonstrated to be superior in efficacy to placebo, since equivalent or worse efficacy than placebo will preclude approvability. Consequently, a one-sided test for efficacy is required.</p>
<p>The null hypothesis is that the drug is equal or worse than placebo. The alternative hypothesis is that the drug has greater efficacy than placebo. A Type I error occurs only when it is concluded that a study drug is effective when in fact it is not. This can occur in only one tail of the distribution of the treatment difference. Further details of the arguments for one-sided tests in placebo-controlled trials are available in statistical publications (Fisher 1991; Koch 1991; Overall 1991; and Peace 1991).</p>
<p>The argument for one-sided tests does not necessarily transfer to safety measures, in general, because one can accept a certain level of toxicity in the presence of strong efficacy. That is, safety is evaluated as part of a benefit/risk ratio.</p>
<p>Note that this justification is similar to that used by regulatory agencies worldwide that routinely require one-sided tests for toxicological oncogenicity studies. In that case, the interest is not in whether a drug seems to lessen the occurrence of cancer; the interest is in only one tail of the distribution, namely whether the drug causes cancer to a greater extent than the control.</p>
<p>Different regulatory agencies require different type I error rates. Treatment differences that are significant at the .025 Î±-level will be declared to be âstatistically significant.â When a computed p-value falls between .025 and .05, the differences will be described as âmarginally statistically significant.â This approach satisfies regulatory agencies who have accepted a one-sided test at the .05 level, and other regulatory agencies who have requested a two-sided test at the .05 level, or equivalently, a one-sided test at the .025 level. In order to facilitate the review of the final study report, two-sided p-values will be presented in addition to the one-sided p-values.</p></div>","SECTION 4.3.4.","NarrativeContent","623cbd67-f21c-4cc0-9f3d-d1ccb6ef0873","4.3.4.","NarrativeContent_56","One-sided Justification"
"<div><p>When there are multiple outcomes, and the study drug is declared to be effective when at least one of these outcomes achieves statistical significance in comparison with a placebo control, a downward adjustment to the nominal Î±-level is necessary. A well-known simple method is the Bonferroni method, that divides the overall Type I error rate, usually .05, by the number of multiple outcomes. So, for example, if there are two multiple outcomes, the study drug is declared to be effective if at least one of the two outcomes is significant at the .05/2 or .025 level.</p>
<p>However, when one has the situation that is present in this study, where there are 2 (or 3 for Europe) outcome variables, each of which must be statistically significant, then the adjustment of the nominal levels is in the opposite direction, that is upwards, in order to maintain an overall Type 1 error rate of .05.</p>
<p>In the case of two outcomes, ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+, if the two variables were completely independent, then each variable should be tested at the nominal Î±-level of .05 1/2 = .2236 level. So if both variables resulted in a nominal p-value less than or equal to .2236, then we would declare the study drug to be effective at the overall Type 1 error rate of .05.</p>
<p>We expect these two outcome measures to be correlated. From the first large-scale 
efficacy study of oral xanomeline, Study MC-H2Q-LZZA, the correlation between 
CIBIC+ and the change in ADAS-Cog(11) from baseline was .252. Consequently, we</p>
<p>plan to conduct a randomization test to combine these two dependent dose-response p-values into a single test, which will then be at the .05 Type I error level. Because there will be roughly 300!/(3 * 100!) possible permutations of the data, random data permutations will be sampled (10,000 random permutations).</p>
<p>Designate the dose response p-values as p1 and p2 (computed as one-sided p-values), for ADAS-Cog(11) and CIBIC+, respectively. The rejection region is defined as</p>
<p>[ {p1 â¤ Î± and p2 â¤ Î±} ].</p>
<p>The critical value, Î±, will be determined from the 10,000 random permutations by choosing the value of Î± to be such that 2.5% of the 10,000 computed pairs of dose response p-values fall in the rejection region. This will correspond to a one-sided test at the .025 level, or equivalently a two-sided test at the .05 level. In addition, by determining the percentage of permuted samples that are more extreme than the observed data, a single p-value is obtained.</p></div>","SECTION 4.3.5.","NarrativeContent","2085b7d1-f9f1-4e7e-b26b-5563992b80cc","4.3.5.","NarrativeContent_57","Nominal P-value Adjustments"
"<div><p>Although safety data is collected at the 24 week visit for retrieved dropouts, these data will not be included in the primary analysis of safety.</p>
<p>Pearson's chi-square test will be used to analyze 3 reasons for study discontinuation (protocol completed, lack of efficacy, and adverse event), the incidence of abnormal (high or low) laboratory measures during the postrandomization phase, and the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. The analysis of laboratory data is conducted by comparing the measures to the normal reference ranges (based on a large Lilly database), and counting patients in the numerator if they ever had a high (low) value during the postrandomization phase.</p>
<p>Additionally, for the continuous laboratory tests, an analysis of change from baseline to endpoint will be conducted using the same ANOVA model described for the efficacy measures in Section 4.3. Because several laboratory analytes are known to be nonnormally distributed (skewed right), these ANOVAs will be conducted on the ranks.</p>
<p>Several outcome measures will be extracted and analyzed from the Ambulatory ECG tapes, including number of pauses, QT interval, and AV block (first, second, or third degree). The primary consideration will be the frequency of pauses. The number of pauses greater than or equal to 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 seconds will be tabulated.

The method developed by Enas and Offen (1993) will be used as a guideline as to whether or not to stop one treatment arm, or the study, to declare ineffectiveness. The outcome of the interim analyses will not affect in any way the conduct, results, or analysis of the current study, unless the results are so negative that they lead to a decision to terminate further development of xanomeline TTS in AD.

"<div><p>An analysis of the cardiovascular safety monitoring (see section 3.9.4) will be performed when approximately 25 patients from each treatment arm have completed at least 2 weeks at the treatment arms' respective full dosage (Visit 5). If necessary, this analysis will be repeated every 25 patients per arm. This analysis will be conducted under the auspices of the DSMB. This board membership will be composed of 3 external cardiologists who will be the voting members of the board, a Lilly cardiologist, a Lilly statistician, and the Lilly research physician in charge of the study. Only the DSMB is authorized to review completely unblinded cardiovascular safety analyses and, if necessary, to disseminate those results. The outcome of the cardiovascular safety analyses will determine the need for further Ambulatory ECGs.</p></div>","SECTION 4.7.","NarrativeContent","17856db6-33a7-4e02-b05c-b915aba0cfe5","4.7.","NarrativeContent_61","Interim Safety Analyses"
"<div><p>Plasma concentrations of xanomeline will be determined from samples obtained at selected visits (Section 3.9.2). The plasma concentration data for xanomeline, dosing information, and patient characteristics such as weight, gender and origin will be pooled and analyzed using a population pharmacokinetic analysis approach (for example, NONMEM). This approach preserves the individual pharmacokinetic differences through structural and statistical models. The population pharmacokinetic parameters through the structural model, and the interindividual and random residual variability through the components of the statistical models will be estimated. An attempt will also be made to correlate plasma concentrations with efficacy and safety data by means of population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling.</p></div>","SECTION 4.8.","NarrativeContent","fa651a12-feee-4356-a675-864c14952313","4.8.","NarrativeContent_62","Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses"

"<div><p>In the United States and Canada, the investigator is responsible for preparing the informed consent document. The investigator will use information provided in the current [Clinical Investigator's Brochure or product information] to prepare the informed consent document.</p>
<p>The informed consent document will be used to explain in simple terms, before the patient is entered into the study, the risks and benefits to the patient. The informed consent document must contain a statement that the consent is freely given, that the patient is aware of the risks and benefits of entering the study, and that the patient is free to withdraw from the study at any time.</p>
<p>As used in this protocol, the term âinformed consentâ includes all consent and/or assent given by subjects, patients, or their legal representatives.</p>
<p>In addition to the elements required by all applicable laws, the 3 numbered paragraphs below must be included in the informed consent document. The language may be altered to match the style of the informed consent document, providing the meaning is unchanged. In some circumstances, local law may require that the text be altered in a way that changes the meaning. These changes can be made only with specific Lilly approval. In these cases, the ethical review board may request from the investigator documentation evidencing Lilly's approval of the language in the informed consent document, which would be different from the language contained in the protocol. Lilly shall, upon request, provide the investigator with such documentation.</p>

release the information regarding, or obtained as a result of, my 
participation in this study to Lilly, including its agents and contractors; 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other governmental 
agencies; and to allow them to inspect all my medical records. I 
understand that medical records that reveal my identity will remain 
confidential, except that they will be provided as noted above or as 
may be required by law.â</p></li>
<li><p>âIf I follow the directions of the doctors in charge of this study and I 
am physically injured because of any substance or procedure properly 
given me under the plan for this study, Lilly will pay the medical 
expenses for the treatment of that injury which are not covered by my 
own insurance, by a government program, or by any other third party. 
No other compensation is available from Lilly if any injury occurs.â</p></li>
